Some classes I've served as the teaching assistant for at SBU:

I've also had the pleasure of mentoring several students in the Directed Reading Programs of [CUNY](https://sites.google.com/view/cunydrp/home) and [SBU](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/drp). I've mentored the following projects there:

- Fourier Analysis & Its Applications
- Elements of Statistical Learning

Additionally, in Spring 2022, I served as a volunteer TA for an online version [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/index.html) targeted towards those from the Global South and other under-represented groups.
