As Instructor:
- Understanding Machine Learning (ESE 188), Spring 2025 \& Fall 2025. This was a general audience 3-credit course, aimed at gaining an intuitive understanding of modern machine learning techniques. This was a super interested course to prepare and teach, and I'm happy to chat about this experience with anyone preparing a similar course!

Some classes I've served as the teaching assistant for at SBU:
- Random Signals and Systems (ESE 306), Spring 2022 & Summer 2022, Graduate Teaching Assistant \[[Recitation Notes](/assets/pdf/ESE_306_Recitation_Notes_All.pdf)\]
- Programming Fundamentals (ESE 124), Fall 2021, Graduate Teaching Assistant
- Classical Physics I (PHY 131), Fall 2020, Undergraduate Teaching Assistant

I've also had the pleasure of mentoring several students in the Directed Reading Programs of [CUNY](https://sites.google.com/view/cunydrp/home) and [SBU](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/drp). I've mentored the following projects there:
- Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization
- Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning
- Probabilistic Machine Learning
- Fourier Analysis & Its Applications
- Elements of Statistical Learning

Additionally, in Spring 2022, I served as a volunteer TA for an online version [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/index.html) targeted towards those from the Global South and other under-represented groups.
