I'm a third-year PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) working with [Petar DjuriÄ‡](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/petardjuric/). My research interests include Bayesian machine learning, statistics, and causal structure learning. 

I previously did my undergrad at Stony Brook in math and statistics. Some previous projects I've contributed to include [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), the open-source animation engine by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) for his videos, [IVQ](https://github.com/SBUtltmedia/VQ) an interactive video quiz tool designed for universities used by several hundreds of students at Stony Brook, and some [random robotics things](https://github.com/SachemAftershock).

Additionally, I'm a Senator in the [SBU Graduate Student Organization](https://www.stonybrookgso.org), and was recently a member of [Project REACH](https://www.stonybrook.edu/reach/about/index.php) and the [SBU Strategic Planning Steering Committee](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/strategicplan/committee.php).

Other things I've been active in include the Directed Reading Programs of [CUNY](https://sites.google.com/view/cunydrp/home) and [SBU](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/drp), where I mentor students in semester-long reading projects in math, machine learning in statistics. I also served on the organizing committee of [SBUHacks](https://sbuhacks.org), the largest hackathon on Long Island, for several years.
