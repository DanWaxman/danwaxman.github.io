I'm a fifth-year PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) working with [Petar Djurić](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/petardjuric/). During Summer 2025, I was a research intern [Basis](https://basis.ai), where I worked on problems in applied Bayesian ML and causality. I'm broadly interested in Bayesian machine learning and causality, and have worked more specifically in sequential and online learning, Bayesian ensemble algorithms, and differentiable causal discovery. I'm particularly interested in advancing theoretical methods in pursuit of applications, and am a member of the [Southwest Integrated Field Laboratory](https://sw-ifl.asu.edu/people), where I've worked with [Katia Lamer](https://katialamer.weebly.com/) in applying ML techniques to applied experimental design problems. You can find more about my research interests in publications on my [research page](research).



Prior to graduate school, I also completed my undergrad at Stony Brook in math and statistics. At Stony Brook, I've served as a Senator in the [SBU Graduate Student Organization](https://www.stonybrookgso.org), the Graduate Council, and was a member of the [SBU Strategic Planning Steering Committee](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/strategicplan/committee.php). For the past several years, I've participated in the Directed Reading Programs of [CUNY](https://sites.google.com/view/cunydrp/home) and [SBU](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/drp), where I mentor students in semester-long reading projects in math, machine learning, and statistics.
