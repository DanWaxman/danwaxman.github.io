I'm a fourth-year PhD student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) working with [Petar Djurić](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/petardjuric/). For Summer 2025, I'll be a Research Intern at [Basis](https://basis.ai). I'm broadly interested in Bayesian machine learning and causality, with some more specific interests in online and continual learning and Gaussian processes. I'm particularly interested in advancing theoretical methods in pursuit of applications, for example in the earth sciences with [SW-IFL](https://sw-ifl.asu.edu/people#:~:text=Daniel%20Waxman%2C%20BNL) or in [conciousness science](https://selcrec.ece.stonybrook.edu/team.html#:~:text=Daniel%20Waxman,-Research%20Assistant). You can find more about my research interests in publications on my [research page](research).

Prior to graduate school, I also completed my undergrad at Stony Brook in math and statistics. I'm a Senator in the [SBU Graduate Student Organization](https://www.stonybrookgso.org), and was recently a member of [Project REACH](https://www.stonybrook.edu/reach/about/index.php) and the [SBU Strategic Planning Steering Committee](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/strategicplan/committee.php). For the past several years, I've participated in the Directed Reading Programs of [CUNY](https://sites.google.com/view/cunydrp/home) and [SBU](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/drp), where I mentor students in semester-long reading projects in math, machine learning in statistics.
