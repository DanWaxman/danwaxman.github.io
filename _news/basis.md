I had a great time as a research intern at [Basis](https://basis.ai) this summer, where I worked with Rafal Urbaniak and Jack Feser on problems in applied Bayesian ML and causality. I'm super excited to join back full-time as a postdoctoral fellow in January 2026, working on tools for dynamical systems with Matt Levine at Basis and Youssef Marzouk at MIT!
